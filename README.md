# Better Skill Capped

[Skill Capped](https://www.skill-capped.com/) has some great content, but the website leaves much to be desired. It doesn't have search functionality, the video player is minimal, and figuring out what to watch next is more difficult than it should be.

Luckily Skill Capped provides a manifest of all their video data embeded right into the HTML they serve! This is a small React app that renders the video data in a nice interface.
