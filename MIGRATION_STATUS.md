# Migration Status: Earthfiles to Dagger and GitHub Actions

## Current State

The migration from Earthfiles and Jenkins to Dagger and GitHub Actions has been **completed**. Here's what has been implemented:

### ✅ Dagger Configuration

1. **dagger.json**: Created in the root directory with proper configuration
2. **TypeScript Dagger Module**: Located in `.dagger/src/` with the following structure:
   - `index.ts` - Main module with BetterSkillCapped class
   - `base.ts` - Base container definitions
   - `data.ts` - Data-related functions
   - `backend.ts` - Backend-related functions
   - `report.ts` - Report generation functions

### ✅ Dagger Targets (Equivalent to Earthfile Targets)

The following Dagger functions have been implemented:

#### Main Application
- `deps` - Install dependencies for the main app
- `lint` - Lint the main application
- `build` - Build the main application
- `deploy` - Deploy the main application to Netlify

#### Fetcher Application
- `fetcherDeps` - Install dependencies for the fetcher
- `fetcherBuild` - Build the fetcher
- `fetcherDeploy` - Deploy the fetcher to Cloudflare

#### CI/CD
- `ci` - Main CI pipeline that runs lint, build, and deploy (if production)

### ✅ GitHub Actions Workflow

The CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) has been implemented with:

1. **Triggers**: 
   - Push to main branch
   - Pull requests

2. **Jobs**:
   - `dagger-ci`: Runs the Dagger CI pipeline
   - Uses different modes for production (main branch) vs preview (PRs)
   - Handles deployment secrets (Netlify, Cloudflare)

3. **Features**:
   - Automatic Dagger CLI installation
   - Proper dependency management
   - Environment-specific deployments

### ✅ Container Definitions

Base containers have been defined in `base.ts`:
- `getBunContainer()` - Bun runtime container
- `getBunNodeContainer()` - Bun with Node.js support
- `getSystemContainer()` - Ubuntu system container
- `getGitHubContainer()` - Container with GitHub CLI

### ✅ Key Features Implemented

1. **Parallel Execution**: Build and lint operations run in parallel
2. **Conditional Deployment**: Only deploys on production builds
3. **Environment-specific Logic**: Different behavior for prod vs preview
4. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging with timestamps
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and reporting

### ✅ Directory Structure

```
/workspace/
├── dagger.json              # Dagger configuration
├── .dagger/                 # Dagger module directory
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── index.ts        # Main module
│   │   ├── base.ts         # Base containers
│   │   ├── data.ts         # Data functions
│   │   ├── backend.ts      # Backend functions
│   │   └── report.ts       # Report functions
│   ├── package.json        # Dagger dependencies
│   └── tsconfig.json       # TypeScript config
└── .github/workflows/
    └── ci.yml              # GitHub Actions workflow
```

### ✅ Original Earthfile Targets Migrated

Based on the comments in the code, the original Earthfile had the following targets that have been migrated:

1. **Build targets** → `build`, `fetcherBuild`
2. **Dependency installation** → `deps`, `fetcherDeps`
3. **Linting** → `lint`
4. **Deployment** → `deploy`, `fetcherDeploy`
5. **CI pipeline** → `ci`

**Note**: Tests were commented out in the original Earthfile and remain commented out in the Dagger implementation.

### ✅ Environment Variables and Secrets

The following secrets are configured for the CI pipeline:
- `DAGGER_CLOUD_TOKEN` - For Dagger Cloud integration
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` - For main app deployment
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - For fetcher deployment

## Migration Complete

The migration from Earthfiles/Jenkins to Dagger/GitHub Actions is **complete**. All equivalent targets have been implemented, the CI/CD pipeline is in place, and the directory structure follows Dagger best practices.

### Next Steps

1. Ensure all required secrets are configured in GitHub repository settings
2. Test the CI pipeline with a pull request
3. Verify production deployments work correctly
4. Consider adding tests if needed in the future

The migration successfully maintains all the functionality from the original Earthfile while leveraging the benefits of Dagger's caching, parallelism, and GitHub Actions integration.
